This is a utility to track information about which branch the author
was working on when creating each commit. This can make it easier to
figure out the context of a particular commit without tracing it to
the nearest merge/branch point.

The script "add-hdr-to-head.rb" can be used as a post-commit hook that
will modify the head commit object to contain information about the
current branch. The result is saved as a new commit object and the
branch head is changed to point to the new object.

Information about the working branch can be retrieved from a
particular commit object by issuing the following command:

 git cat-file -p 1cb7f76b5 | grep ^x-working-branch


Why?
----

In a typical git workflow, you can see the relationship of all
commits, but context information, such as in which branch a particular
commit was introduced, is sometimes hard to find. You may have to
trace back (or forward) to the nearest branch or merge to see if a
commit came from a branch called "experimental" or
"maintenance". Adding this metadata to the commit object preserves
this information without cluttering the commit log message.
